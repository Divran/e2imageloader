# e2imageloader

This is an E2 that, with some help from the php script, can load any jpg, png or gif (non animated gif only) from anywhere on the internet, and then display it on a digital screen.

To use it, simply 
* place the php script on any server you have. Alternatively use something like xampp to host a server on your own computer.
* Next, change the url near the top of the E2 to point to the php script on your server.
* Read the E2's comments for more information about the other options.
* Then, spawn the E2 on a digital screen (or near it and wire it up manually) and your selected image will load.
Alternatively use the chat command (default ">") to load an image (aim at the digital screen or the E2 to choose which screen to load it at).

If you would like to load the image faster, you can also spawn any amount of "loadshare" E2s. These will automatically connect to the main E2 and be used to make the image load faster.
